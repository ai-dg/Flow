description: >-
  Offers the user an informed choice about how much response depth to
  consume before answering. Use this skill when the user explicitly
  wants to control response length, depth, or token budget.
  TRIGGER when: "token budget", "token count", "token usage", "token limit",
  "response length", "answer depth", "short version", "brief answer",
  "detailed answer", "exhaustive answer", or clear variants where the
  user is explicitly asking to control answer size or depth.
  DO NOT TRIGGER when: user has already specified a level in the current
  session (maintain it), the request is clearly a one-word answer, or
  "token" refers to auth/session/payment tokens rather than response size.

# Token Budget Advisor (TBA)

Intercept the response flow to offer the user a choice about response depth **before** Claude answers.

## When to Use

- User wants to control how long or detailed a response is
- User mentions tokens, budget, depth, or response length
- User says "short version", "tldr", "brief", "exhaustive", etc.
- Any time the user wants to choose depth/detail level upfront

**Do not trigger** when: user already set a level this session (maintain it silently), or the answer is trivially one line.

## How It Works

### Step 1 — Estimate input tokens

Use the canonical context-budget heuristics:
- prose: `words × 1.3`
- code-heavy or mixed/code blocks: `chars / 4`

### Step 2 — Estimate response size by complexity

| Complexity   | Multiplier range | Example prompts                                      |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Simple       | 3× – 8×          | "What is X?", yes/no, single fact                   |
| Medium       | 8× – 20×         | "How does X work?"                                  |
| Medium-High  | 10× – 25×        | Code request with context                           |
| Complex      | 15× – 40×        | Multi-part analysis, comparisons, architecture      |
| Creative     | 10× – 30×        | Stories, essays, narrative writing                  |

Response window = `input_tokens × mult_min` to `input_tokens × mult_max`

### Step 3 — Present depth options

Present this block **before** answering:

```
Analyzing your prompt...

Input: ~[N] tokens  |  Type: [type]  |  Complexity: [level]

Choose your depth level:

[1] Essential   (25%)  ->  ~[tokens]   Direct answer only, no preamble
[2] Moderate    (50%)  ->  ~[tokens]   Answer + context + 1 example
[3] Detailed    (75%)  ->  ~[tokens]   Full answer with alternatives
[4] Exhaustive (100%)  ->  ~[tokens]   Everything, no limits

Which level? (1-4 or say "25% depth", "50% depth", "75% depth", "100% depth")
```

### Step 4 — Respond at the chosen level

| Level            | Target length       | Include                                             | Omit                                              |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 25% Essential    | 2-4 sentences max   | Direct answer, key conclusion                       | Context, examples, nuance, alternatives           |
| 50% Moderate     | 1-3 paragraphs      | Answer + necessary context + 1 example              | Deep analysis, edge cases, references             |
| 75% Detailed     | Structured response | Multiple examples, pros/cons, alternatives          | Extreme edge cases, exhaustive references         |
| 100% Exhaustive  | No restriction      | Everything — full analysis, all code, all perspectives | Nothing                                        |

## Shortcuts — skip the question

| What they say                                      | Level |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------|
| "1" / "25% depth" / "short version" / "brief" / "tldr"  | 25%   |
| "2" / "50% depth" / "moderate" / "balanced"             | 50%   |
| "3" / "75% depth" / "detailed" / "thorough"             | 75%   |
| "4" / "100% depth" / "exhaustive" / "full deep dive"    | 100%  |

If the user set a level earlier in the session, **maintain it silently** for subsequent responses unless they change it.
